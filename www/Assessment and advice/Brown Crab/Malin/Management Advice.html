    <p align="justify">The crab fishery is managed by a minimum landing size of 140 mm 
    carapace width. There are kilowatt day effort limits on vessels over 10 m in the 
    biologically sensitive area which includes coasts from north Mayo south and east to 
    Waterford and on vessels over 15 m in ICES area VI.</p>
    
    <p>
      Although the MLS of 140 mm protects the stock from recruitment overfishing, 
      the data clearly signal a decline in stock abundance and a likely decline in recruitment. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Standardised indices of stock abundance and a stock assessment in the Malin 
      Shelf fishery show a steep decline in landings per unit effort. 
      These trends are also generally observed in other crab stocks off the Irish coast. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Advice based on the negative trends in stock indices or on the fishing mortality
      (F/Fmsy) ratio, in the case of the Malin stock, all indicate the need to reduce 
      fishing mortality. Corresponding landings in 2025 for the Malin Shelf (all fleets
      combined including UK) is 4,078 tonnes using the recommended ICES advice rule, 
      or 4,336 tonnes at F/Fmsy = 1.
