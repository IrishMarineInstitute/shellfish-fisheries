    <span class="term">Catch rates</span>
</div>

    Number of fish caught in relation to the amount of fishing gear. Catch rates will therefore be expressed as the unit of weight or numbers of fish by the unit of fishing gear used
    (e.g. Number\Pot, Kg\Dredge...). Catch rates can also specify the portion of the catch which they refer too such as Landings per Unit of Effort (LPUE), 
    Discards per Unit of Effort (DPUE), Catch per Unit of Effort (CPUE; aggregate of landings and discards), V-notch lobsters per Unit of Effort (VPUE) and so on.

</div>
<div class="definition">
    Living animals, plants and non-living structures that exist together and ‘interact’ with each other. Ecosystems can be very small (the area around a boulder), 
    they can be medium sized (the area around a coral reef) or they can be very large (the Irish Sea or even the eastern Atlantic).

<div class="term">
    <span class="term">Exploitation rate</span>
</div>
<div class="definition">
    The proportion of a population at the beginning of a given time period that is caught during that time period (usually expressed on a yearly basis). For example, 
    if 720,000 fish were caught during the year from a population of 1 million fish alive at the beginning of the year, the annual exploitation rate would be 0.72.

</div>
<div class="definition">
    A measure of the physical size and engine power of the fishing fleet expressed as gross tonnage (GTs) and kilowatts (KWs).
</div>

<div class="term">
    <span class="term">Fleet Segment</span>
</div>
<div class="definition">
    A measure of the physical size and engine power of the fishing fleet expressed as gross tonnage (GTs) and kilowatts (KWs).
</div>

<div class="term">
    <span class="term">Growth overfishing</span>
</div>
<div class="definition">
    Reduced yields of fish due to reduction in average size/weight/age caused by fishing mortality and indicating that the rate of fishing is higher than the rate 
    at which fish grow to given sizes to replace those being removed
</div>

<div class="term">
    <span class="term">Management Plan</span>
</div>
<div class="definition">
    Agreed plan to manage a stock. With defined objectives, implementation measures or harvest control rules, review processes and usually stakeholder agreement and involvement.
</div>

<div class="term">
    <span class="term">Management Units</span>
</div>
<div class="definition">

    For example, the number of fish that grow to become vulnerable to the fishing gear in one year would be the recruitment to the fishable population that year. 
    This term is also used in referring to the number of fish from a year class reaching a certain age. For example, all fish reaching their second year would be age 2 recruits.

</div>
<div class="definition">
    Various reference points can be defined for fished stocks. These can be used as a management target or a management trigger

    indicator eg catch rate reference points or those based on biological observations.
