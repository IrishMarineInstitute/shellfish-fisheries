2022,Cockle,Dundalk,"<p>The Dundalk Bay cockle fishery is managed under a Fisheries Natura (management) Plan (FNP) which is a legal mechanism to incorporate environmental protection measures into fisheries management plans when such fisheries occur in Natura 2000 sites. </p>

<p>No fishing occurs at biomass less than 1200 tonnes. The fishery closes when the TAC (17-33 % of biomass over 1200 tonnes) is taken or on November 1st or if the average catch per boat per day declines below 250 kg. The minimum landing size is 22 mm shell width. A quota of 1 tonne per vessel per day for 28 permit holders is in force.</p>

<p>The stock is assessed by annual survey and in season LPUE data. Trends in other ecosystem indicators (benthic habitats, bird populations) are integrated into management advice and the FNP. </p>

<p>Pre-fishery survey estimate of cockle biomass in 2021 was 1,927 tonnes compared to 3,790 and 3,420 tonnes 2019 and 2020 respectively following on from a strong recruitment in 2018. The TAC in 2021 was 642 tonnes of which 638 tonnes were landed.</p>

<p>The harvest control rules in the 2021-2025 FNP should be implemented annually. The FNP will be reviewed in 2025. The estimation of post fishery cockle biomass should be improved.</p>

<p>Maintenance of favourable conservation status of intertidal habitats in which cockle fisheries occur is a primary management objective in order to reduce the risk of future recruitment failure and to ensure that conservation objectives for designated habitats and species are protected. Any cockle fisheries in other SACs or SPAs should be subject to management plans considering their potential effects on designated habitats and birds.</p>
",,"<p>The management measures for the Dundalk fishery are described in 5 year Fishery Natura plans (FNPs; 2011-2016, 2016-2020, 2021-2025) and harvest rules are implemented through annual legislation in the form of Natura Declarations (<a href= ""http://www.fishingnet.ie/""> fishing.ie</a>). These plans were subject to screening and appropriate assessment as required by the EU Habitats Directive Article 6 and the EU Birds and Habitats Regulations (S.I. 290 of 2013).</p>

<p>In Dundalk Bay a cockle permit is required to fish for cockles either by vessel or by hand gathering. The number of vessel permits is limited to 28 (formerly 33).</p>

<p>.Annual TAC is set according to harvest control rules set out in the FNP and based on the biomass estimated from a mid-summer survey. There is no fishing at biomass below 1200 tonnes. Landings are capped at 1200 tonnes when biomass reaches 2400 tonnes. At higher biomass levels therefore the harvest rate declines as biomass increases. The cap of 1200 tonnes is to avoid bumper years which could de-stabilise the market. Depending on overwintering mortality this also helps to support and stabilise fisheries in successive years when recruitment is weak. The fishery closes if the average catch per boat per day declines to 250 kg even if the TAC is not taken. This provides additional precaution given uncertainty in the survey estimates. Opening and closing dates are specified annually. The latest closing date of November 1st is implemented even if the TAC has not been taken or if the catch rate remains above the limit for closure. Vessels can fish between the hours of 06:00 and 22:00. Maximum landing per vessel per day is 1 tonne. Dredge width should not exceed 0.75 m in the case of suction dredges and 1.0 m for non-suction dredges. The national minimum legal landing size is 17 mm but operationally and by agreement of the licence holders the minimum size landed in Dundalk Bay is 22 mm. This is implemented by using 22 mm bar spacing on drum graders on board the vessels.</p> 

<p>Environmental performance indicators are reviewed annually as part of the management plans and the prospect of an annual fishery depends on annual evidence that there is no causal link between cockle fishing and in particular the abundance of oystercatcher and other species of bird that feed on bivalves and the status of characterising bivalve species in intertidal habitats.</p>","<p>A pre-fishery survey was completed between 23-25th May 2022. A total of 373 stations, were sampled, using two different gears: scientific quadrats covering an area of 0.25 m2 and rakes covering an area of 2 m2, resulting in approximately 839 m2 of Dundalk Bay being sampled. GPS locations from each station were recorded using Trimble GPS units. The total area surveyed was 27.8 km2.</p>

<p>Biomass at each station was estimated based on density (number of individuals caught per square metre of sampled area) and a species specific weight-length relationship. Total biomass was then estimated as the sum of mean estimated biomass, using a geostatistical (kriging) model with a zone effect (between the Northern and Southern areas), raised to the surface area.</p> 
","<p>Total biomass was 1,826 tonnes based on a Geostatistical model, with a significant increase in cockle below 18mm. Biomass of cockles over 22 mm was 912 tonnes. The highest densities (Kg.m-2) of cockles occurred throughout the middle of the surveyed area, with one major hotspot at the northern limits of the southern zone. </p> 

<p>A total of 6,022 cockles were measured from the 2022 survey.  A strong recruitment event is evident based on the size distribution plot for the 2022 survey with a strong cohort at 8mm size. A second cohort is observed at 18mm size, following the growth progression of the small cohort detected in the 2021 survey. The main 2021 mode of large cockle ~27mm has decreased, as also indicated in the interannual biomass reduction for this size range.</p>"

<p>Landings in the North Irish Sea declined between 2015-2021. The number of vessels in the fishery increased from 49 in 2015 to 73 in 2016 and 2017 and declined to 56 in 2019. All indicators (daily landings per vessel, catch per hour) show significant and persistent declines up to 2017 but were stable from 2017-2020. Estimates of biomass, revised following a review of data standardisation protocols in 2020, varied from approximately 9,000 tonnes in 2017 to between 6,000-7,000 tonnes in 2018-2020 and 9,145 in 2021. Exploitation rate was 7.5 % per annum. Large size classes were depleted between 2017 and 2018 but were stable or increased between 2018-2021. Based on average landings 2019-2021 or applying the average exploitation rate for the period 2019-2021 of 7.5% to the average survey estimates for the same period landings in 2022 should not exceed 563 tonnes.</p>
",,"<p>The North Irish Sea (NIS) fishery began in the early 1980s and quickly developed due to high quality (size) of clams in the Gormanstown bed which attracted premium prices compared to other Ensis species fished in Europe. There may have been 50 vessels in the fishery by 1999. Post 2003 beds at Malahide, Skerries and south Dundalk Bay were being fished in addition to the Gormanstown bed.  The number of vessels in the fishery, total fishing effort and annual landings expanded significantly between 2014 and 2018. The fishery has supported over 70 vessels in recent years and landings peaked at over 1,100 tonnes and a value of approx. 6.5m euros in 2015. The catch is exported mainly to the Far East. Unit prices vary by grade or shell size from 4-10 euros per kg. The fishery, relative to other shellfish, could be classed as medium price and medium volume. 
The fishery occurs close to the coast in shallow sub-tidal waters along the east coast from Dundalk south to Malahide.</p>","<p>A total of 781 tows were undertaken using five different vessels, with hydraulic dredges ranging from 0.86-1.2m width. GPS data for each tow line was recorded on a Trimble GPS survey unit. Following a standardized protocol applied to the 2017-2021 survey data, GPS tracks were inspected to identify potentially erroneous tracks due to lack of GPS track connectivity, and a Gaussian Kernel regression technique was applied as a way to smooth unrealistic spikes resulting from the position accuracy (1-3m) of the Trimble units. Based on the final track length and the gear width, swept area for each tow was estimated, resulting in a total sampling effort of 22568 m2.</p>

<p>Biomass at each station was estimated as the product of density (number of individuals caught per meter squared towed area) and mean individual weight calculated from the size distribution at the station and a weight-length relationship. Biomass was then interpolated over a 200 m x 200 m grid using ordinary kriging on log(biomass). Total biomass was then estimated as the sum of mean estimated biomass, using a geostatistical (kriging) model, raised to the surface area of the cells. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals were estimated based upon random realisations of the modelled biomass using conditional Gaussian simulations. This method preserves the spatial structure in the biomass, as described by variograms, which modelled the spatial autocorrelation and spatial structure in the survey data.</p>
","<p>Biomass of all size classes of razors uncorrected for dredge efficiency varied from 0-0.57 kgs.m-2. Distribution of high density patches is similar across size ranges. The estimated biomass was 9,244 tonnes, with 90% of the total biomass above the 130 mm MLS.</p>

<p>The size distribution of razor clams in the North Irish Sea in 2022 shows a rightward move due to growth in the ~120mm cohort observed in the 2021 survey. Densities of razors above the MLS of 130 mm remains similar to the 2021 survey. </p>
