    <h3>Landings</h3>
    
    <p>Throughout the time series, from 1980 to 2023, Irish vessels landed the largest proportion of Brown crab from the Malin stock. Irish landings peaked in 2004 at almost 8,000 tonnes; this peak did not occur in the Scottish or Northern Irish data. Scottish landings remained relatively stable since the early â€˜90s. Northern Irish landings peaked in 2017 and have since fallen to lowest official (not reconstructed) values (Figure 1).</p>
    
    <h3>Biomass Indices</h3>
    
    <p>Two potential indices of abundance are available for the stock:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Daily landings per unit effort (LPUE) collected in the SVP or earlier versions of
      it from 1996-2020 and </li>
      <li>Georeferenced haul by haul LPUE, from the Irish Offshore crab fleet
      from 1991-2006.</li> 
      </ol>
      
      <p>Additional information available in both datasets include soak times and unique
      vessel identifiers. Data on discards was available in the SVP programme but are not
      always reported and are not included here.</p>
      
      <p>Commercial catch rate data can be used as a true index of abundance if the effects
      on catch rates of factors (co-variates) other than changes in crab abundance can be
      accounted for. This process is usually referred as catch rate standardization. In the
      case of the SVP programme, only trips targeting crab were used in the standardization
      analysis to reduce the variance in the LPUE estimates that would result if vessels
      targeting lobsters with a crab by-catch were included. When the target species
      intention was not recorded for a particular vessel or trip, it was assumed that vessels
      above 8 m total length tend to target brown crab. An extensive data exploration was
      carried out before any model implementation to identify potential issues, such as
      outliers (in both landings or effort) or missing data.
      
      <p>Two indices of abundance were created by standardising the catch rates of both data sources using Generalised Additive Models. </p>
      
      <p>
      The SVP index shows a relative increase in LPUE in the first 10 years of the 
      time series, although inter-annual variability suggest data quality issues in 
      this period (Figure 2). A sharp decrease in the standardized LPUE occurred 
      from 2014 onwards, although there are signs of slight recovery in 2020-2023.
      The limited sampling in 2008 for the Malin stock (4 vessels only compared 
      to on average 13-15 vessels) are likely to be causing this outlying estimate. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The offshore vivier standardized index shows a declining trend at the beginning 
      of the time series and stable LPUE between 1994 and 2000 followed by small 
      declines from 2000-2006 (Figure 3).
