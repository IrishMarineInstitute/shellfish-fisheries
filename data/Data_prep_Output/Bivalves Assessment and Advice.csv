2023,Oyster,Clew Bay Westport,"<p>Native oyster (<i>Ostrea edulis</i>) stocks are in most cases managed locally by Oyster Co-operatives who have delegated authority to manage oysters in specific areas. The fishery is managed primarily by a minimum landing size (MLS) of 76-78 mm. The minimum size is generally reached at age 4-5. Oysters generally mature well below the MLS. Local quotas or TACs may be in force. The number of dredge permits issued annually to each co-operative by Inland Fisheries Ireland is limited.</p>

<p>Stocks are assessed by annual surveys which provide biomass estimates, although dredge efficiency (catchability) is uncertain. <b>Assuming a 35% dredge efficency, this years total biomass estimate was 22.6 tonnes, 22% of which was above the 76mm MLS</b>. Stock biomass is generally depleted in all areas, except inner Tralee Bay, and management measures to restore recruitment and re-build spawning stocks are necessary. Various threats to native oyster stocks exist including naturalisation of Pacific oyster (<i>Magallana gigas</i>), Bonamia infection, poor water quality, unfavourable habitat conditions for settlement and low spawning stocks. Pacific oyster has naturalised in Lough Swilly in recent years and supports a commercial fishery.</p>

<p>Generally, although seasonal quotas and minimum size regulations are in place for some fisheries, management plans or recovery plans should be developed in order to restore productivity of stocks. A range of actions should be considered including areas closed to fishing where spawning stock could be re-built, removal of Pacific oysters, maintenance or recovery of habitat for settlement, development of harvest control rules and improving operational management locally. Draft management plans are in place for a number of co-operatives as of 2023.</p>

<p>Oyster beds are also constituents of habitats designated under the Habitats Directive in many areas. Specific conservation objectives have been defined for these habitats in some sites. Oyster management plans also need to consider the conservation objectives for oyster habitat or for habitat in which oyster is a characterising species.</p>
","<p>Native oysters (<i>Ostrea edulis</i>) are bivalve molluscs. Oysters are a protandric hermaphrodite species, meaning they mature first as a male and then have the ability to change between male and female later in life. Males release sperm into the water column and females brood the fertilised eggs in their gills. One female can produce 500,000 to 1 million larvae in a spawning season after brooding the eggs for 8-10days in their gills.</p>

<p>Native oysters are filter feeders, consuming plankton and detritus from the water column. They are predated on by various species, including humans, crabs, whelks and starfish. They are often referred to as &#39;ecosystem engineers&#39; because of the important ecosystem service they provide, including creating reef habitats which attracts other species and can protect against coastal erosion and improve water quality through filter feeding.</p>

<p>The distribution of native oysters extends from the Norwegian Sea in the North, the Southern North Sea, around Ireland and Britain and south as far as the Mediterranean Sea, naturally inhabiting lower intertidal and shallow subtital habitats. In oyster sites on the west coast of Ireland, spawning occurs frequently if not annually and larval settlement is dependent on seawater temperatures in mid summer. Growth is seasonal, with a significant increase during the summer months and slow or even negative growth (due to shell edge erosion) in winter.</p>

","<p>Oysters are fished with simple light weight dredges fitted with a blade or toothed bar depending on area of fishing and ground type. The vessels involved can vary from 5-6 m open punts to half deckers between 8-14 m. The fishing season may be written into the fishery orders eg Galway Bay is open to fishing in December only. In other cases fishing generally occurs from September to January. Fishing may not occur every year and in recent years there has been no fishing in many areas because of low stock levels. Oysters are usually sold centrally through the co-operatives.</p>

<p>Native oyster stocks were extirpated from large areas of the north Sea and Irish Sea by fishing in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Overfishing in coastal areas has also led to decline in coastal beds. Since the 1980s this decline was exacerbated following the accidental introduction of the haplosporidian parasite <i>Bonamia ostrea</i>.</p>
","<p>A survey was carried out on 5<sup>th</sup> December on the oyster beds in the Westport area of Clew Bay.  A total of 71 tows were undertaken covering four oyster beds with a single toothless dredge (blade) of width 1.22m. One of the oyster beds, where 9 tows were conducted, was excluded from the assessment to provide a better comparison with the area covered in 2022. The final combined survey area was 1.33km<sup>2</sup>, with a total sampling effort of 6554m<sup>2</sup>. </p> 

<p>GPS data for each tow line was recorded on a Trimble GPS survey unit and swept area for each tow estimated. The density (number of oysters per m<sup>2</sup>) for each tow was calculated by multiplying the area of each tow by the number of oysters caught. The densities were subsequently interpolated using an Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) algorithm. Contours were drawn at intervals reflecting the range in observed densities. A dredge efficiency co-efficient of 35% was applied to assessment outputs, calculated as the average of different dredge efficiency experiments in oyster beds around Ireland.</p>","<p>The biomass of oysters in Westport Bay, uncorrected for dredge efficiency was 7.8&#177;3.1 tonnes, with densities ranging from 0-3.78 oyster/m<sup>2</sup>. Higher densities of all oysters occurred in the most northerly bed, whereas oysters >76mm were more evenly distributed across the two larger beds . Assuming a dredge efficiency of 35%, estimated biomass was 22.6&#177;8.9 tonnes with densities ranging from 0-10.8 oyster/m<sup>2</sup>. Biomass of oysters >76mm, assuming a dredge efficiency of 35%, was estimated to 4.9&#177;1.1 tonnes, representing 22% of the total biomass. The biomass estimates for Westport Bay in 2023 are very similar to estimates from 2022, but the survey area in 2023 is more than double that of 2022 so despite the steady biomass across the two years, more effort was needed to catch the same weight of oysters this year.</p> "

In the South Irish Sea management measures include an MLS of 130 mm, fishing hours from 07:00 to 19:00, 2 tonne quota per vessel per week, 1 dredge per vessel not to exceed 122 cm width with bar spacing not less than 10 mm, prior notice of intention to fish and advance notice of landing, mandatory submission of gatherers docket information on landings, date and location of fishing and a defined fishing area to minimise overlap with Natura 2000 sites. All vessels report GPS position at 10 minutes or higher frequency.</p>

<p>Many razor clam fisheries or potential fisheries occur within or close to Natura 2000 sites. The conservation objectives for species and habitats in these areas are integrated into razor clam fishery management advice.

Maturation occurs below the minimum landing size of 130mm.</p>
","<p>Razor clams are fished mainly in shallow waters of the western Irish Sea from Dundalk Bay south to Malahide and also along the east Wexford coast. Fishing involves use of hydraulic non-suction dredges which fluidises sediment to a depth of 25cm in front of the dredge and dislodges clams that are then caught in the dredge. Fishing depth is limited by the functioning of the hydraulics and capacity to generate high water pressure at the dredge head. In the Irish Sea fishing occurs from the low water mark seaward to about 15m. Clams are landed and sold live mainly to the Asian market. There are about 70 vessels in the fishery.

<p>Annual TAC is set according to harvest control rules defined in the FNP (<a href=""http://www.fishingnet.ie/sea-fisheriesinnaturaareas/concludedassessments/dundalkbay-sacspa/"">available here</a>) and based on the biomass estimated from a mid-summer survey. <b>This years survey biomass estimate was 2,603 tonnes, from which 1,930 tonnes were above the minimum landing size</b>. There is no fishing at biomass below 1,000 tonnes. TACs of 17-33 % of biomass apply over 1,000 tonnes. Landings are capped at 1,200 tonnes when biomass reaches 2,400 tonnes. At higher biomass levels therefore the harvest rate declines as biomass increases. The cap of 1,200 tonnes is to avoid bumper years which could de-stabilise the market. Depending on overwintering mortality this also helps to support and stabilise fisheries in successive years when recruitment is weak. The fishery closes if the average catch per boat per day declines to 250 kg even if the TAC is not taken. This provides additional precaution given uncertainty in the survey estimates. Opening and closing dates are specified annually. The latest closing date of November 1<sup>st</sup> is implemented even if the TAC has not been taken or if the catch rate remains above the limit for closure. A quota of 1 tonne per vessel per day for 28 permit holders is in force.  Vessels can fish between the hours of 06:00 and 22:00. Dredge width should not exceed 0.75 m in the case of suction dredges and 1.0 m for non-suction dredges. The national minimum legal landing size is 17 mm but operationally and by agreement of the licence holders the minimum size landed in Dundalk Bay is 22 mm. This is implemented by using 22 mm bar spacing on drum graders on board the vessels.</p> 

<p>Environmental performance indicators are reviewed annually as part of the management plans and the prospect of an annual fishery depends on annual evidence that there is no causal link between cockle fishing and, in particular, the abundance of oystercatcher and other species of bird that feed on bivalves and the status of characterising bivalve species in intertidal habitats. Overfishing of cockles can have catastrophic effects on bird populations leading to displacement from the site, mortality or reduced reproductive fitness.</p>

<p>Maintenance of favourable conservation status of intertidal habitats in which cockle fisheries occur is a primary management objective in order to reduce the risk of future recruitment failure and to ensure that conservation objectives for designated habitats and species are protected.

2022,Oyster,Fenit,"<p>Native oyster (<i>Ostrea edulis</i>) stocks are in most cases managed locally by Oyster Co-operatives who have delegated authority to manage oysters in specific areas. The fishery is managed primarily by a minimum landing size (MLS) of 76-78 mm. The minimum size is generally reached at age 4-5. Oysters generally mature well below the MLS. Local quotas or TACs may be in force. The number of dredge permits issued annually to each co-operative by Inland Fisheries Ireland is limited.</p>

<p>Stocks are assessed by annual surveys which provide biomass estimates, although dredge efficiency (catchability) is uncertain. <b>Assuming a 35% dredge efficency, this years total biomass estimate was 801 tonnes, 29% of which was above the 76mm MLS</b>. Stock biomass is generally depleted in all areas, except inner Tralee Bay, and management measures to restore recruitment and re-build spawning stocks are necessary. Various threats to native oyster stocks exist including naturalisation of Pacific oyster (<i>Magallana gigas</i>), Bonamia infection, poor water quality, unfavourable habitat conditions for settlement and low spawning stocks. Pacific oyster has naturalised in Lough Swilly in recent years and supports a commercial fishery.</p>

<p>Generally, although seasonal quotas and minimum size regulations are in place for some fisheries, management plans or recovery plans should be developed in order to restore productivity of stocks. A range of actions should be considered including areas closed to fishing where spawning stock could be re-built, removal of Pacific oysters, maintenance or recovery of habitat for settlement, development of harvest control rules and improving operational management locally. Draft management plans are in place for a number of co-operatives as of 2023.</p>

<p>Oyster beds are also constituents of habitats designated under the Habitats Directive in many areas. Specific conservation objectives have been defined for these habitats in some sites. Oyster management plans also need to consider the conservation objectives for oyster habitat or for habitat in which oyster is a characterising species.</p>
","<p>Native oysters (<i>Ostrea edulis</i>) are bivalve molluscs. Oysters are a protandric hermaphrodite species, meaning they mature first as a male and then have the ability to change between male and female later in life. Males release sperm into the water column and females brood the fertilised eggs in their gills. One female can produce 500,000 to 1 million larvae in a spawning season after brooding the eggs for 8-10days in their gills.</p>

<p>Native oysters are filter feeders, consuming plankton and detritus from the water column. They are predated on by various species, including humans, crabs, whelks and starfish. They are often referred to as &#39;ecosystem engineers&#39; because of the important ecosystem service they provide, including creating reef habitats which attracts other species and can protect against coastal erosion and improve water quality through filter feeding.</p>

<p>The distribution of native oysters extends from the Norwegian Sea in the North, the Southern North Sea, around Ireland and Britain and south as far as the Mediterranean Sea, naturally inhabiting lower intertidal and shallow subtital habitats. In oyster sites on the west coast of Ireland, spawning occurs frequently if not annually and larval settlement is dependent on seawater temperatures in mid summer. Growth is seasonal, with a significant increase during the summer months and slow or even negative growth (due to shell edge erosion) in winter.</p>

","<p>Oysters are fished with simple light weight dredges fitted with a blade or toothed bar depending on area of fishing and ground type. The vessels involved can vary from 5-6 m open punts to half deckers between 8-14 m. The fishing season may be written into the fishery orders eg Galway Bay is open to fishing in December only. In other cases fishing generally occurs from September to January. Fishing may not occur every year and in recent years there has been no fishing in many areas because of low stock levels. Oysters are usually sold centrally through the co-operatives.</p>

The conservation objectives for species and habitats in these areas are integrated into razor clam fishery management advice.Ecosystem effects of fishing may include changes to the deep burrowing bivalve community in shallow sediments and potentially reduced prey availability to diving seaducks (Common Scoter) although this species feeds primarily on smaller bivalves at the sediment surface.</p>","<p>Razor clams (<i>Ensis siliqua</i>/<i>Ensis magnus</i>) are a species of deep burrowing bivalve inhabiting mixed sediments in shallow coastal water. Exact sediment requirements (grain size) varies by species. They are a component species of a deep burrowing megafauna community of species which also includes many other bivalve species such as otter shell (<i>Lutraria</i> sp), spiny cockle (<i>Acanthocardia</i> sp), blood razors (<i>Pharus legumen</i>) and Icelandic clam (<i>Arctica islandica</i>). They have a free swimming pelagic larval phase which aids dispersal although juvenile and adult clams may also swim and move to new locations. Growth is rapid in the first 3 years but slows with age; Clams at commercial size may be over 5 years. Spawning may occur from May to July. Maturation occurs below the minimum landing size of 130mm.</p>

","<p>Razor clams are fished mainly in shallow waters of the western Irish Sea from Dundalk Bay south to Malahide and also along the east Wexford coast. Fishing involves use of hydraulic non-suction dredges which fluidises sediment to a depth of 25cm in front of the dredge and dislodges clams that are then caught in the dredge. Fishing depth is limited by the functioning of the hydraulics and capacity to generate high water pressure at the dredge head. In the Irish Sea fishing occurs from the low water mark seaward to about 15m. Clams are landed and sold live mainly to the Asian market. There are about 70 vessels in the fishery. The fishery has expanded geographically and in total effort in recent years and is now a very important inshore fishery in the Irish Sea.</p>

<p>Smaller fisheries for razor clams occur on the west coast around Clifden Bay, Inisbofin, Killary, Iniskeas, Blacksod Bay, Broadhaven Bay and other areas. These have been fished under management plans in recent years but most are currently closed.</p>
","<p>A total of 761 tows were undertaken using five different vessels, with hydraulic dredges ranging from 0.95-1.2m width. GPS data for each tow line was recorded on a Trimble GPS survey unit. Following a standardized protocol applied to the 2017-2020 survey data, GPS tracks were inspected to identify potentially erroneous tracks due to lack of GPS track connectivity, and a Gaussian Kernel regression technique was applied as a way to smooth unrealistic spikes resulting from the position accuracy (1-3m) of the Trimble units. Based on the final track length and the gear width, swept area for each tow was estimated, resulting in a total sampling effort of 17,880 m<sup>2</sup>. </p>

<p>Biomass at each station was estimated as the product of density (number of individuals caught per meter squared towed area) and mean individual weight calculated from the size distribution at the station and a weight-length relationship. Biomass was then interpolated over a 200 m x 200 m grid using ordinary kriging on log(biomass). Total biomass was then estimated as the sum of mean estimated biomass, using a geostatistical (kriging) model, raised to the surface area of the cells. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals were estimated based upon 500 random realisations of the modelled biomass using conditional Gaussian simulations. This method preserves the spatial structure in the biomass, as described by variograms, which modelled the spatial autocorrelation and spatial structure in the survey data.</p> ","<p>Biomass of all size classes of razors uncorrected for dredge efficiency varied from 0-0.54 kgs/m<sup>2</sup>. Distribution of high density patches is similar across size ranges. The estimated biomass was 9,145 tonnes, with 80% of the total biomass above the 130 mm MLS.</p>

<p>The size distribution of razor clams in the North Irish Sea in 2021 shows a significant recruitment pulse compared to the 2020 survey with mode at approximately 120 mm. Densities of razors above the MLS of 130 mm remains similar to the 2020 survey with a slight shift towards the right due to growth.</p>

2021,Cockle,Dundalk,"<p>The Dundalk Bay cockle (<i>Cerastoderma edule</i>) fishery is managed under a Fisheries Natura (management) Plan (FNP) which is a legal mechanism to incorporate environmental protection measures into fisheries management plans when such fisheries occur in Natura 2000 sites.  Harvest control rules are implemented through annual legislation in the form of Natura Declarations (<a href= ""http://www.fishingnet.ie/""> fishing.ie</a>). These plans were subject to screening and appropriate assessment as required by the EU Habitats Directive Article 6 and the EU Birds and Habitats Regulations (S.I. 290 of 2013).</p> 

<p>The stock is assessed by annual survey. Trends in other ecosystem indicators (benthic habitats, bird populations) are integrated into management advice and the FNP.</p>

<p>Annual TAC is set according to harvest control rules defined in the FNP (<a href=""http://www.fishingnet.ie/sea-fisheriesinnaturaareas/concludedassessments/dundalkbay-sacspa/"">available here</a>) and based on the biomass estimated from a mid-summer survey.  <b>This years survey biomass estimate was 1,926 tonnes, from which 1,694 tonnes were above the minimum landing size</b>. There is no fishing at biomass below 1,000 tonnes. TACs of 17-33 % of biomass apply over 1,000 tonnes. Landings are capped at 1,200 tonnes when biomass reaches 2,400 tonnes. At higher biomass levels therefore the harvest rate declines as biomass increases. The cap of 1,200 tonnes is to avoid bumper years which could de-stabilise the market. Depending on overwintering mortality this also helps to support and stabilise fisheries in successive years when recruitment is weak. The fishery closes if the average catch per boat per day declines to 250 kg even if the TAC is not taken. This provides additional precaution given uncertainty in the survey estimates. Opening and closing dates are specified annually. The latest closing date of November 1<sup>st</sup> is implemented even if the TAC has not been taken or if the catch rate remains above the limit for closure. A quota of 1 tonne per vessel per day for 28 permit holders is in force. Vessels can fish between the hours of 06:00 and 22:00. Dredge width should not exceed 0.75 m in the case of suction dredges and 1.0 m for non-suction dredges. The national minimum legal landing size is 17 mm but operationally and by agreement of the licence holders the minimum size landed in Dundalk Bay is 22 mm. This is implemented by using 22 mm bar spacing on drum graders on board the vessels.</p> 

<p>Environmental performance indicators are reviewed annually as part of the management plans and the prospect of an annual fishery depends on annual evidence that there is no causal link between cockle fishing and, in particular, the abundance of oystercatcher and other species of bird that feed on bivalves and the status of characterising bivalve species in intertidal habitats. Overfishing of cockles can have catastrophic effects on bird populations leading to displacement from the site, mortality or reduced reproductive fitness.</p>

<p>Maintenance of favourable conservation status of intertidal habitats in which cockle fisheries occur is a primary management objective in order to reduce the risk of future recruitment failure and to ensure that conservation objectives for designated habitats and species are protected. Any cockle fisheries in other SACs or SPAs should be subject to management plans considering their potential effects on designated habitats and birds.</p>
",<p>Cockles (<i>Cerastoderma edule</i>) are a shallow burrowing bivalve inhabiting mixed sediments in intertidal estuaries and mudflats.

In Dundalk Bay growth is fast and commercial size (17mm) can be attained after 1 winter.

The Dundalk fishery occurs in early autumn and includes 28 permit holders. Landings vary annually from 0-700 tonnes depending on stock biomass. Cockles are sold to the UK and to Europe. </p>

<p>A total of 3,767 cockles were measured from the 2021 survey.  Compared to the 2020 surveyed data, the size of cockles in 2021 increased, however a considerable reduction in the biomass of cockles above the minimum landing size was observed. The modal size distribution in the 2021 cockle data survey is approximately 25 mm compared to 22 mm in 2020. The majority of the cockles observed in 2021 were above the MLS of 18 mm.

2021,Oyster,Fenit,"<p>Native oyster (<i>Ostrea edulis</i>) stocks are in most cases managed locally by Oyster Co-operatives who have delegated authority to manage oysters in specific areas. The fishery is managed primarily by a minimum landing size (MLS) of 76-78 mm. The minimum size is generally reached at age 4-5. Oysters generally mature well below the MLS. Local quotas or TACs may be in force. The number of dredge permits issued annually to each co-operative by Inland Fisheries Ireland is limited.</p>

<p>Stocks are assessed by annual surveys which provide biomass estimates, although dredge efficiency (catchability) is uncertain. <b>Assuming a 35% dredge efficency, this years total biomass estimate was 617 tonnes, 28% of which was above the 76mm MLS</b>. Stock biomass is generally depleted in all areas, except inner Tralee Bay, and management measures to restore recruitment and re-build spawning stocks are necessary. Various threats to native oyster stocks exist including naturalisation of Pacific oyster (<i>Magallana gigas</i>), Bonamia infection, poor water quality, unfavourable habitat conditions for settlement and low spawning stocks. Pacific oyster has naturalised in Lough Swilly in recent years and supports a commercial fishery.</p>

<p>Generally, although seasonal quotas and minimum size regulations are in place for some fisheries, management plans or recovery plans should be developed in order to restore productivity of stocks. A range of actions should be considered including areas closed to fishing where spawning stock could be re-built, removal of Pacific oysters, maintenance or recovery of habitat for settlement, development of harvest control rules and improving operational management locally. Draft management plans are in place for a number of co-operatives as of 2023.</p>

<p>Oyster beds are also constituents of habitats designated under the Habitats Directive in many areas. Specific conservation objectives have been defined for these habitats in some sites.

","<p>Native oysters (<i>Ostrea edulis</i>) are bivalve molluscs. Oysters are a protandric hermaphrodite species, meaning they mature first as a male and then have the ability to change between male and female later in life. Males release sperm into the water column and females brood the fertilised eggs in their gills. One female can produce 500,000 to 1 million larvae in a spawning season after brooding the eggs for 8-10days in their gills.</p>

<p>Native oysters are filter feeders, consuming plankton and detritus from the water column. They are predated on by various species, including humans, crabs, whelks and starfish. They are often referred to as &#39;ecosystem engineers&#39; because of the important ecosystem service they provide, including creating reef habitats which attracts other species and can protect against coastal erosion and improve water quality through filter feeding.</p>

<p>The distribution of native oysters extends from the Norwegian Sea in the North, the Southern North Sea, around Ireland and Britain and south as far as the Mediterranean Sea, naturally inhabiting lower intertidal and shallow subtital habitats. In oyster sites on the west coast of Ireland, spawning occurs frequently if not annually and larval settlement is dependent on seawater temperatures in mid summer. Growth is seasonal, with a significant increase during the summer months and slow or even negative growth (due to shell edge erosion) in winter.</p>

","<p>Oysters are fished with simple light weight dredges fitted with a blade or toothed bar depending on area of fishing and ground type. The vessels involved can vary from 5-6 m open punts to half deckers between 8-14 m. The fishing season may be written into the fishery orders eg Galway Bay is open to fishing in December only. In other cases fishing generally occurs from September to January. Fishing may not occur every year and in recent years there has been no fishing in many areas because of low stock levels. Oysters are usually sold centrally through the co-operatives.</p>

<p>Native oyster stocks were extirpated from large areas of the north Sea and Irish Sea by fishing in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.

2020,Oyster,Fenit,"<p>Native oyster (<i>Ostrea edulis</i>) stocks are in most cases managed locally by Oyster Co-operatives who have delegated authority to manage oysters in specific areas. The fishery is managed primarily by a minimum landing size (MLS) of 76-78 mm. The minimum size is generally reached at age 4-5. Oysters generally mature well below the MLS. Local quotas or TACs may be in force. The number of dredge permits issued annually to each co-operative by Inland Fisheries Ireland is limited.</p>

<p>Stocks are assessed by annual surveys which provide biomass estimates, although dredge efficiency (catchability) is uncertain. <b>Assuming a 35% dredge efficency, this years total biomass estimate was 1,618 tonnes, 29% of which was above the 76mm MLS</b>. Stock biomass is generally depleted in all areas, except inner Tralee Bay, and management measures to restore recruitment and re-build spawning stocks are necessary. Various threats to native oyster stocks exist including naturalisation of Pacific oyster (<i>Magallana gigas</i>), Bonamia infection, poor water quality, unfavourable habitat conditions for settlement and low spawning stocks. Pacific oyster has naturalised in Lough Swilly in recent years and supports a commercial fishery.</p>

<p>Generally, although seasonal quotas and minimum size regulations are in place for some fisheries, management plans or recovery plans should be developed in order to restore productivity of stocks. A range of actions should be considered including areas closed to fishing where spawning stock could be re-built, removal of Pacific oysters, maintenance or recovery of habitat for settlement, development of harvest control rules and improving operational management locally. Draft management plans are in place for a number of co-operatives as of 2023.</p>

<p>Oyster beds are also constituents of habitats designated under the Habitats Directive in many areas. Specific conservation objectives have been defined for these habitats in some sites. Oyster management plans also need to consider the conservation objectives for oyster habitat or for habitat in which oyster is a characterising species.</p>
","<p>Native oysters (<i>Ostrea edulis</i>) are bivalve molluscs. Oysters are a protandric hermaphrodite species, meaning they mature first as a male and then have the ability to change between male and female later in life. Males release sperm into the water column and females brood the fertilised eggs in their gills. One female can produce 500,000 to 1 million larvae in a spawning season after brooding the eggs for 8-10days in their gills.</p>

<p>Native oysters are filter feeders, consuming plankton and detritus from the water column. They are predated on by various species, including humans, crabs, whelks and starfish. They are often referred to as &#39;ecosystem engineers&#39; because of the important ecosystem service they provide, including creating reef habitats which attracts other species and can protect against coastal erosion and improve water quality through filter feeding.</p>

<p>The distribution of native oysters extends from the Norwegian Sea in the North, the Southern North Sea, around Ireland and Britain and south as far as the Mediterranean Sea, naturally inhabiting lower intertidal and shallow subtital habitats. In oyster sites on the west coast of Ireland, spawning occurs frequently if not annually and larval settlement is dependent on seawater temperatures in mid summer. Growth is seasonal, with a significant increase during the summer months and slow or even negative growth (due to shell edge erosion) in winter.</p>

","<p>Oysters are fished with simple light weight dredges fitted with a blade or toothed bar depending on area of fishing and ground type. The vessels involved can vary from 5-6 m open punts to half deckers between 8-14 m. The fishing season may be written into the fishery orders eg Galway Bay is open to fishing in December only. In other cases fishing generally occurs from September to January. Fishing may not occur every year and in recent years there has been no fishing in many areas because of low stock levels. Oysters are usually sold centrally through the co-operatives.</p>

<p>Native oyster stocks were extirpated from large areas of the north Sea and Irish Sea by fishing in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Overfishing in coastal areas has also led to decline in coastal beds.

2019,Cockle,Dundalk,"<p>The Dundalk Bay cockle (<i>Cerastoderma edule</i>) fishery is managed under a Fisheries Natura (management) Plan (FNP) which is a legal mechanism to incorporate environmental protection measures into fisheries management plans when such fisheries occur in Natura 2000 sites.  Harvest control rules are implemented through annual legislation in the form of Natura Declarations (<a href= ""http://www.fishingnet.ie/""> fishing.ie</a>). These plans were subject to screening and appropriate assessment as required by the EU Habitats Directive Article 6 and the EU Birds and Habitats Regulations (S.I. 290 of 2013).</p> 

<p>The stock is assessed by annual survey. Trends in other ecosystem indicators (benthic habitats, bird populations) are integrated into management advice and the FNP.</p>

<p>Annual TAC is set according to harvest control rules defined in the FNP (<a href=""http://www.fishingnet.ie/sea-fisheriesinnaturaareas/concludedassessments/dundalkbay-sacspa/"">available here</a>) and based on the biomass estimated from a mid-summer survey.  <b>This years survey biomass estimate was 3,790 tonnes, from which 1,162 tonnes were above the minimum landing size</b>. There is no fishing at biomass below 750 tonnes.  TACs of 33 % of biomass apply between 750 and 3000 tonnes. TAC of 50% of biomass applies when biomass exceeds 3000 tonnes. The fishery closes if the average catch per boat per day declines to 250 kg even if the TAC is not taken. This provides additional precaution given uncertainty in the survey estimates. Opening and closing dates are specified annually. The latest closing date of November 1<sup>st</sup> is implemented even if the TAC has not been taken or if the catch rate remains above the limit for closure. A quota of 1 tonne per vessel per day for 28 permit holders is in force. Vessels can fish between the hours of 06:00 and 22:00. Dredge width should not exceed 0.75 m in the case of suction dredges and 1.0 m for non-suction dredges. The national minimum legal landing size is 17 mm but operationally and by agreement of the licence holders the minimum size landed in Dundalk Bay is 22 mm. This is implemented by using 22 mm bar spacing on drum graders on board the vessels.</p> 

<p>Environmental performance indicators are reviewed annually as part of the management plans and the prospect of an annual fishery depends on annual evidence that there is no causal link between cockle fishing and, in particular, the abundance of oystercatcher and other species of bird that feed on bivalves and the status of characterising bivalve species in intertidal habitats. Overfishing of cockles can have catastrophic effects on bird populations leading to displacement from the site, mortality or reduced reproductive fitness.</p>

<p>Maintenance of favourable conservation status of intertidal habitats in which cockle fisheries occur is a primary management objective in order to reduce the risk of future recruitment failure and to ensure that conservation objectives for designated habitats and species are protected. Any cockle fisheries in other SACs or SPAs should be subject to management plans considering their potential effects on designated habitats and birds.</p>
",<p>Cockles (<i>Cerastoderma edule</i>) are a shallow burrowing bivalve inhabiting mixed sediments in intertidal estuaries and mudflats. Cockles have a free swimming pelagic larval phase and settlement of new recruits can occur in spring and autumn. Recruitment is strongly linked to environmental conditions during the larval phase. In Dundalk Bay growth is fast and commercial size (17mm) can be attained after 1 winter. This is a significant reason why the stock can support a fishery given that natural mortality can be extremely high overwinter. Winter mortality is caused mainly by bird predation but also extreme weather events.</p>,"<p>The only significant fishery for cockles in Ireland occurs in Dundalk Bay. There are many cockle beds in other Irish coastal areas but none provide sufficiently stable conditions (stock biomass) for fishing. Fishing involves the use of suction and non-suction hydraulic dredges which penetrate the sediment to a depth of approximately 5cm. Hand gathering permits have been issued in the past in Dundalk. The Dundalk fishery occurs in early autumn and includes 28 permit holders. Landings vary annually from 0-700 tonnes depending on stock biomass. Cockles are sold to the UK and to Europe. </p>

"
2019,Oyster,Fenit,"<p>Native oyster (<i>Ostrea edulis</i>) stocks are in most cases managed locally by Oyster Co-operatives who have delegated authority to manage oysters in specific areas. The fishery is managed primarily by a minimum landing size (MLS) of 76-78 mm. The minimum size is generally reached at age 4-5. Oysters generally mature well below the MLS. Local quotas or TACs may be in force. The number of dredge permits issued annually to each co-operative by Inland Fisheries Ireland is limited.</p>

<p>Stocks are assessed by annual surveys which provide biomass estimates, although dredge efficiency (catchability) is uncertain. <b>Assuming a 35% dredge efficency, this years total biomass estimate was 879 tonnes, 29% of which was above the 76mm MLS</b>. Stock biomass is generally depleted in all areas, except inner Tralee Bay, and management measures to restore recruitment and re-build spawning stocks are necessary. Various threats to native oyster stocks exist including naturalisation of Pacific oyster (<i>Magallana gigas</i>), Bonamia infection, poor water quality, unfavourable habitat conditions for settlement and low spawning stocks. Pacific oyster has naturalised in Lough Swilly in recent years and supports a commercial fishery.</p>

<p>Generally, although seasonal quotas and minimum size regulations are in place for some fisheries, management plans or recovery plans should be developed in order to restore productivity of stocks. A range of actions should be considered including areas closed to fishing where spawning stock could be re-built, removal of Pacific oysters, maintenance or recovery of habitat for settlement, development of harvest control rules and improving operational management locally. Draft management plans are in place for a number of co-operatives as of 2023.</p>

<p>Oyster beds are also constituents of habitats designated under the Habitats Directive in many areas. Specific conservation objectives have been defined for these habitats in some sites. Oyster management plans also need to consider the conservation objectives for oyster habitat or for habitat in which oyster is a characterising species.</p>
","<p>Native oysters (<i>Ostrea edulis</i>) are bivalve molluscs. Oysters are a protandric hermaphrodite species, meaning they mature first as a male and then have the ability to change between male and female later in life. Males release sperm into the water column and females brood the fertilised eggs in their gills. One female can produce 500,000 to 1 million larvae in a spawning season after brooding the eggs for 8-10days in their gills.</p>

<p>Native oysters are filter feeders, consuming plankton and detritus from the water column. They are predated on by various species, including humans, crabs, whelks and starfish. They are often referred to as &#39;ecosystem engineers&#39; because of the important ecosystem service they provide, including creating reef habitats which attracts other species and can protect against coastal erosion and improve water quality through filter feeding.</p>

<p>The distribution of native oysters extends from the Norwegian Sea in the North, the Southern North Sea, around Ireland and Britain and south as far as the Mediterranean Sea, naturally inhabiting lower intertidal and shallow subtital habitats. In oyster sites on the west coast of Ireland, spawning occurs frequently if not annually and larval settlement is dependent on seawater temperatures in mid summer. Growth is seasonal, with a significant increase during the summer months and slow or even negative growth (due to shell edge erosion) in winter.</p>

","<p>Oysters are fished with simple light weight dredges fitted with a blade or toothed bar depending on area of fishing and ground type. The vessels involved can vary from 5-6 m open punts to half deckers between 8-14 m. The fishing season may be written into the fishery orders eg Galway Bay is open to fishing in December only. In other cases fishing generally occurs from September to January. Fishing may not occur every year and in recent years there has been no fishing in many areas because of low stock levels. Oysters are usually sold centrally through the co-operatives.</p>

<p>Native oyster stocks were extirpated from large areas of the north Sea and Irish Sea by fishing in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Overfishing in coastal areas has also led to decline in coastal beds. Since the 1980s this decline was exacerbated following the accidental introduction of the haplosporidian parasite <i>Bonamia ostrea</i>.</p>
","<p>An annual survey was carried out on October 1st and 2nd on the Fenit Oyster Bed. A total of 57 tows were undertaken, with a single toothless dredge of width 1.20m. GPS data for each tow line was recorded on a Trimble GPS survey unit and swept area for each tow estimated. The survey encompassed an area of 3.7 km<sup>2</sup> east of Fenit pier.</p> ","<p>Similar to 2018 the 2019 size distribution of oysters caught during the survey shows a strong mode at about 70mm and a smaller mode at 20-40mm.  The density of oysters at the higher mode of 70mm decreased in October 2019 from September 2018.  Inter-annual variability in the biomass estimates could be due to a possible difference in dredging efficiency between years and must therefore be interpreted with caution. Total biomass of oysters, assuming a dredge efficiency of 35%, was 879 tonnes. The equivalent biomass of oysters 76m or over was 257 tonnes.</p>"

2018,Cockle,Dundalk,"<p>The Dundalk Bay cockle (<i>Cerastoderma edule</i>) fishery is managed under a Fisheries Natura (management) Plan (FNP) which is a legal mechanism to incorporate environmental protection measures into fisheries management plans when such fisheries occur in Natura 2000 sites.  Harvest control rules are implemented through annual legislation in the form of Natura Declarations (<a href= ""http://www.fishingnet.ie/""> fishing.ie</a>). These plans were subject to screening and appropriate assessment as required by the EU Habitats Directive Article 6 and the EU Birds and Habitats Regulations (S.I. 290 of 2013).</p> 

<p>The stock is assessed by annual survey. Trends in other ecosystem indicators (benthic habitats, bird populations) are integrated into management advice and the FNP.</p>

<p>Annual TAC is set according to harvest control rules defined in the FNP (<a href=""http://www.fishingnet.ie/sea-fisheriesinnaturaareas/concludedassessments/dundalkbay-sacspa/"">available here</a>) and based on the biomass estimated from a mid-summer survey.  <b>This years survey biomass estimate was 1,785 tonnes, from which 1,378 tonnes were above the minimum landing size</b>. There is no fishing at biomass below 750 tonnes.  TACs of 33 % of biomass apply between 750 and 3000 tonnes. TAC of 50% of biomass applies when biomass exceeds 3000 tonnes. The fishery closes if the average catch per boat per day declines to 250 kg even if the TAC is not taken. This provides additional precaution given uncertainty in the survey estimates. Opening and closing dates are specified annually. The latest closing date of November 1<sup>st</sup> is implemented even if the TAC has not been taken or if the catch rate remains above the limit for closure. A quota of 1 tonne per vessel per day for 32 permit holders is in force. Vessels can fish between the hours of 06:00 and 22:00. Dredge width should not exceed 0.75 m in the case of suction dredges and 1.0 m for non-suction dredges. The national minimum legal landing size is 17 mm but operationally and by agreement of the licence holders the minimum size landed in Dundalk Bay is 22 mm. This is implemented by using 22 mm bar spacing on drum graders on board the vessels.</p> 

<p>Environmental performance indicators are reviewed annually as part of the management plans and the prospect of an annual fishery depends on annual evidence that there is no causal link between cockle fishing and, in particular, the abundance of oystercatcher and other species of bird that feed on bivalves and the status of characterising bivalve species in intertidal habitats. Overfishing of cockles can have catastrophic effects on bird populations leading to displacement from the site, mortality or reduced reproductive fitness.</p>

<p>Maintenance of favourable conservation status of intertidal habitats in which cockle fisheries occur is a primary management objective in order to reduce the risk of future recruitment failure and to ensure that conservation objectives for designated habitats and species are protected. Any cockle fisheries in other SACs or SPAs should be subject to management plans considering their potential effects on designated habitats and birds.</p>
",<p>Cockles (<i>Cerastoderma edule</i>) are a shallow burrowing bivalve inhabiting mixed sediments in intertidal estuaries and mudflats. Cockles have a free swimming pelagic larval phase and settlement of new recruits can occur in spring and autumn. Recruitment is strongly linked to environmental conditions during the larval phase. In Dundalk Bay growth is fast and commercial size (17mm) can be attained after 1 winter. This is a significant reason why the stock can support a fishery given that natural mortality can be extremely high overwinter. Winter mortality is caused mainly by bird predation but also extreme weather events.</p>,"<p>The only significant fishery for cockles in Ireland occurs in Dundalk Bay. There are many cockle beds in other Irish coastal areas but none provide sufficiently stable conditions (stock biomass) for fishing. Fishing involves the use of suction and non-suction hydraulic dredges which penetrate the sediment to a depth of approximately 5cm. Hand gathering permits have been issued in the past in Dundalk. The Dundalk fishery occurs in early autumn and includes 28 permit holders. Landings vary annually from 0-700 tonnes depending on stock biomass. Cockles are sold to the UK and to Europe. </p>

","<p>A pre-fishery survey was completed in June 2018. A total of 390 stations, were sampled, using two different gears: scientific quadrats covering an area 0.25 m<sup>2</sup> and rakes covering an area of 2 m<sup>2</sup>. GPS locations from each stations were recorded using Trimble GPS units. The total area surveyed was 29.6km<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Biomass at each station was estimated based on density (number of individuals caught per square metre of sampled area) and a species specific weight-length relationship.

<p>Native oyster stocks were extirpated from large areas of the north Sea and Irish Sea by fishing in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Overfishing in coastal areas has also led to decline in coastal beds. Since the 1980s this decline was exacerbated following the accidental introduction of the haplosporidian parasite <i>Bonamia ostrea</i>.</p>
","<p>A pre fishery survey was carried out on September 26th and 27th in the Fenit Oyster Bed.  A total of 86 tows were undertaken, with a single toothless dredge of width 1.20m.

The survey encompassed an area of 3.92km<sup>2</sup> east of Fenit pier.</p> ","<p>Biomass of oysters uncorrected for dredge efficiency varied from 0-1 kgs/m<sup>2</sup>. Biomass of oysters over 78mm ranged from 0-0.1 kgs/m<sup>2</sup>. The size distribution of oysters caught during the survey shows a strong mode at about 70mm and a smaller mode at 20-40mm. The location of the mode at 70mm is similar to that in 2017. The similar or even slight left shift in the mode position suggests that mortality, associated with fishing, may occur from 70mm rather than a 'knife edge' selection at 78mm. The substantially highest density recorded for this main mode in 2018, compared to the one recorded in 2017, suggests a possible difference of dredging efficiency between years. Total biomass of oysters, assuming a dredge efficiency of 35%, was 1161 tonnes. The equivalent biomass of oysters 78m or over was 199 tonnes, close to the estimate of 190 tonnes for 2017.</p>"

2017,Cockle,Dundalk,"<p>The Dundalk Bay cockle (<i>Cerastoderma edule</i>) fishery is managed under a Fisheries Natura (management) Plan (FNP) which is a legal mechanism to incorporate environmental protection measures into fisheries management plans when such fisheries occur in Natura 2000 sites.  Harvest control rules are implemented through annual legislation in the form of Natura Declarations (<a href= ""http://www.fishingnet.ie/""> fishing.ie</a>). These plans were subject to screening and appropriate assessment as required by the EU Habitats Directive Article 6 and the EU Birds and Habitats Regulations (S.I. 290 of 2013).</p> 

<p>The stock is assessed by annual survey. Trends in other ecosystem indicators (benthic habitats, bird populations) are integrated into management advice and the FNP.</p>

<p>Annual TAC is set according to harvest control rules defined in the FNP (<a href=""http://www.fishingnet.ie/sea-fisheriesinnaturaareas/concludedassessments/dundalkbay-sacspa/"">available here</a>) and based on the biomass estimated from a mid-summer survey.  <b>This years survey biomass estimate was 2,316 tonnes</b>. There is no fishing at biomass below 750 tonnes.  TACs of 33 % of biomass apply between 750 and 3000 tonnes. TAC of 50% of biomass applies when biomass exceeds 3000 tonnes. The fishery closes if the average catch per boat per day declines to 250 kg even if the TAC is not taken. This provides additional precaution given uncertainty in the survey estimates. Opening and closing dates are specified annually. The latest closing date of November 1<sup>st</sup> is implemented even if the TAC has not been taken or if the catch rate remains above the limit for closure. A quota of 1 tonne per vessel per day for 32 permit holders is in force. Vessels can fish between the hours of 06:00 and 22:00. Dredge width should not exceed 0.75 m in the case of suction dredges and 1.0 m for non-suction dredges. The national minimum legal landing size is 17 mm but operationally and by agreement of the licence holders the minimum size landed in Dundalk Bay is 22 mm. This is implemented by using 22 mm bar spacing on drum graders on board the vessels.</p> 

<p>Environmental performance indicators are reviewed annually as part of the management plans and the prospect of an annual fishery depends on annual evidence that there is no causal link between cockle fishing and, in particular, the abundance of oystercatcher and other species of bird that feed on bivalves and the status of characterising bivalve species in intertidal habitats. Overfishing of cockles can have catastrophic effects on bird populations leading to displacement from the site, mortality or reduced reproductive fitness.</p>

<p>Maintenance of favourable conservation status of intertidal habitats in which cockle fisheries occur is a primary management objective in order to reduce the risk of future recruitment failure and to ensure that conservation objectives for designated habitats and species are protected. Any cockle fisheries in other SACs or SPAs should be subject to management plans considering their potential effects on designated habitats and birds.</p>
",<p>Cockles (<i>Cerastoderma edule</i>) are a shallow burrowing bivalve inhabiting mixed sediments in intertidal estuaries and mudflats. Cockles have a free swimming pelagic larval phase and settlement of new recruits can occur in spring and autumn. Recruitment is strongly linked to environmental conditions during the larval phase. In Dundalk Bay growth is fast and commercial size (17mm) can be attained after 1 winter. This is a significant reason why the stock can support a fishery given that natural mortality can be extremely high overwinter. Winter mortality is caused mainly by bird predation but also extreme weather events.</p>,"<p>The only significant fishery for cockles in Ireland occurs in Dundalk Bay. There are many cockle beds in other Irish coastal areas but none provide sufficiently stable conditions (stock biomass) for fishing. Fishing involves the use of suction and non-suction hydraulic dredges which penetrate the sediment to a depth of approximately 5cm. Hand gathering permits have been issued in the past in Dundalk. The Dundalk fishery occurs in early autumn and includes 28 permit holders. Landings vary annually from 0-700 tonnes depending on stock biomass. Cockles are sold to the UK and to Europe. </p>

",<p>A pre-fishery survey was completed in June 2017. Stations were sampled using two different gears: scientific quadrats covering an area 0.25 m<sup>2</sup> and rakes covering an area of 2 m<sup>2</sup>. GPS locations from each stations were recorded using Trimble GPS units.</p> ,"<p> Total biomass was 2,316 tonnes.</p>

<p>In 2017, a 1+ year old cohort accounted for most of the biomass in  when approximately 50% of the cohort was over the MLS. Cockles aged 0+ were also present in 2017 indicating successful settlement in Spring of 2017.</p>"
2017,Oyster,Fenit,"<p>Native oyster (<i>Ostrea edulis</i>) stocks are in most cases managed locally by Oyster Co-operatives who have delegated authority to manage oysters in specific areas. The fishery is managed primarily by a minimum landing size (MLS) of 76-78 mm. The minimum size is generally reached at age 4-5. Oysters generally mature well below the MLS. Local quotas or TACs may be in force. The number of dredge permits issued annually to each co-operative by Inland Fisheries Ireland is limited.</p>

<p>Stocks are assessed by annual surveys which provide biomass estimates, although dredge efficiency (catchability) is uncertain. <b>Assuming a 35% dredge efficency, this years total biomass estimate was 843 tonnes, 22% of which was above the 78mm MLS</b>. Stock biomass is generally depleted in all areas, except inner Tralee Bay, and management measures to restore recruitment and re-build spawning stocks are necessary. Various threats to native oyster stocks exist including naturalisation of Pacific oyster (<i>Magallana gigas</i>), Bonamia infection, poor water quality, unfavourable habitat conditions for settlement and low spawning stocks. Pacific oyster has naturalised in Lough Swilly in recent years and supports a commercial fishery.</p>

<p>Generally, although seasonal quotas and minimum size regulations are in place for some fisheries, management plans or recovery plans should be developed in order to restore productivity of stocks. A range of actions should be considered including areas closed to fishing where spawning stock could be re-built, removal of Pacific oysters, maintenance or recovery of habitat for settlement, development of harvest control rules and improving operational management locally. Draft management plans are in place for a number of co-operatives as of 2023.</p>

<p>Oyster beds are also constituents of habitats designated under the Habitats Directive in many areas. Specific conservation objectives have been defined for these habitats in some sites. Oyster management plans also need to consider the conservation objectives for oyster habitat or for habitat in which oyster is a characterising species.</p>
","<p>Native oysters (<i>Ostrea edulis</i>) are bivalve molluscs. Oysters are a protandric hermaphrodite species, meaning they mature first as a male and then have the ability to change between male and female later in life. Males release sperm into the water column and females brood the fertilised eggs in their gills. One female can produce 500,000 to 1 million larvae in a spawning season after brooding the eggs for 8-10days in their gills.</p>

<p>Native oysters are filter feeders, consuming plankton and detritus from the water column. They are predated on by various species, including humans, crabs, whelks and starfish. They are often referred to as &#39;ecosystem engineers&#39; because of the important ecosystem service they provide, including creating reef habitats which attracts other species and can protect against coastal erosion and improve water quality through filter feeding.</p>

<p>The distribution of native oysters extends from the Norwegian Sea in the North, the Southern North Sea, around Ireland and Britain and south as far as the Mediterranean Sea, naturally inhabiting lower intertidal and shallow subtital habitats. In oyster sites on the west coast of Ireland, spawning occurs frequently if not annually and larval settlement is dependent on seawater temperatures in mid summer. Growth is seasonal, with a significant increase during the summer months and slow or even negative growth (due to shell edge erosion) in winter.</p>

","<p>Oysters are fished with simple light weight dredges fitted with a blade or toothed bar depending on area of fishing and ground type. The vessels involved can vary from 5-6 m open punts to half deckers between 8-14 m. The fishing season may be written into the fishery orders eg Galway Bay is open to fishing in December only. In other cases fishing generally occurs from September to January. Fishing may not occur every year and in recent years there has been no fishing in many areas because of low stock levels. Oysters are usually sold centrally through the co-operatives.</p>

<p>Native oyster stocks were extirpated from large areas of the north Sea and Irish Sea by fishing in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Overfishing in coastal areas has also led to decline in coastal beds.

GPS data for each tow line was recorded on a Trimble GPS survey unit and swept area for each tow estimated. The survey encompassed an area of 4.28km<sup>2</sup> east of Fenit pier.</p> ","<p>Densities (uncorrected for dredge efficiency) varied from 0-8 oyster/m<sup>2</sup> and were highest in the eastern portion of the bed. The equivalent biomass varied from 0-0.47 kgs/m<sup>2</sup>. Density of oysters over 78mm, uncorrected for dredge efficiency, ranged from 0-0.7 oyster/m<sup>2</sup> and the equivalent biomass ranged from 0-0.34 kgs/m<sup>2</sup>. The size distribution of oysters caught during the survey shows a strong mode at about 70mm and a smaller mode at 20-40mm. Eighteen percent (by number) of oysters were 78mm or over. The decline in number of oysters from 70mm suggests that mortality associated with fishing occurs from this size rather than a ''knife edge'' selection at 78mm. Total biomass of oysters, assuming a dredge efficiency of 35%, was 843&#177;151 tonnes. The equivalent biomass of oysters 78m or over was 193&#177;29 tonnes.</p>"
