    <h3> The Fishery </h3>
    <p>Targeted fisheries for brown crab in Ireland developed during the 1960s. The fishery developed off Malin Head in Donegal and along the Donegal coast and, to a lesser extent, on the south coast during the 1970s. The Malin Head fishery accounted for 25 % of national landings during the 1980s. The offshore fishery developed in 1990 and by the mid-1990s had fully explored the distribution of brown crab on the Malin Shelf. This stock, which extends from Donegal to the edge of the continental shelf and south to Galway, is the largest stock fished by Irish vessels.</p>

    <h3> Species Biology </h3>
    Brown crab or edible crab (<i>Cancer pagurus</i>) is a Decapod crustacean inhabiting a wide range of substrates usually between 6-80 meters depth. The biology and reproductive 
    cicle of brown crab, as with other crustaceans, is characterised by moulting and mating events (June-September), which influences when the fishing occurs as meat yields decrease 
    substantially over this period. After mating, female crabs can spawn between 0.25-3 million eggs, which are carried under her abdomen for a period of seven-eight months before 
    hatching as planktonic larvae. Settlement occurs in intertidal zones until individuals reach 6-7cm carapace with (CW), at which point, crabs migrate to subtidal areas. 
    Sexual maturity is reached at approximately 11cm CW. Size distribution of Irish landings ranges mostly between 150-160 cm CW, above the current minimum landing size of 140 cm CW.
