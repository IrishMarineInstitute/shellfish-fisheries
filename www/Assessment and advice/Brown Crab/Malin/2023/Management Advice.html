    <p align="justify">The crab fishery is managed by a minimum landing size of 140 mm
    carapace width. There are kilowatt day effort limits on vessels over 10 m in the
    biologically sensitive area which includes coasts from north Mayo south and east to
    Waterford and on vessels over 15 m in ICES area VI.</p>
    
    <p>Standardised index of stock abundance and a stock assessment, based on a production
    model, show a steep year on year decline in both landings per unit effort, discards per
    unit effort, increasing fishing mortality and declining biomass since 2014/2015 in the
    Malin Shelf fishery. The production model assessment incorporates landings by Scottish
    and Northern Irish vessels. These trends are also generally observed in other crab stocks
    off the Irish coast.</p> 
    
    <p>Advice based on the negative trends in stock indices or on the fishing mortality (F/Fmsy) ratio, in the case of the Malin stock, all indicate the need to reduce fishing
    mortality. Corresponding landings at F/Fmsy =1 for the Malin Shelf would be 3,900 tonnes
    (all fleets combined) or 4,500 tonnes using other harvest control rules for stocks where
    only relative estimates of fishing mortality and trends are available.</p>
    
    <p>Although the MLS of 140 mm significantly protects the stock from recruitment
    overfishing the data clearly signals a decline in stock abundance and a likely decline in
    recruitment in recent years given that trends in discard rates (of smaller crab) are also
    negative.<p> 
    
    <p>A significant proportion of crab landed is used directly for bait in the whelk fishery. Estimates vary from 1,300-2,000 tonnes. Reduction in landings by that amount would reduce
    fishing mortality close to the Fmsy target.</p>
