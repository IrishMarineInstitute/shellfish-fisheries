    <h3>SPiCT Assessment</h3>
    
    <p>SPiCT (Surplus Production in Continuous Time) is a surplus production model 
    commonly used in fisheries assessments. The model estimates exploitable biomass 
    and fishing mortality, which are indirectly observed via indices of abundance 
    and catch. Process and observation errors are incorporated in the model, which
    is then reflected in the model uncertainty and projected catch advice. </p>
    
    <p>
      A number of model scenarios have been tested, which included varying the 
      length of the time series of landings and abundance indices, as well as 
      adjusting initial settings and priors for key model parameters (e.g., 
      symmetry of the production curve, depletion at the beginning of the time 
      series and intrinsic rate of population growth). All configurations of the 
      model setup resulted in consistent trends and outputs, indicating the 
      assessment is robust to various assumptions. For simplicity, only one 
      scenario is reported here.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The SPiCT model indicates that the stock is overfished (biomass below B<sub>MSY</sub>) 
      and is undergoing overfishing (fishing mortality above F<sub>MSY</sub>).
    </p>



    <h3>Catch advice</h3>
    <p>The assessment indicates that fishing mortality should be reduced. The 
    level of reduction will impact the rate of recovery of the stock biomass. 
    There are a number of harvest control rules that could be adopted; the two 
    suggested rules are the ICES advice rule or fishing at F<sub>MSY</sub> (numbers 3 and 4 
    in Table 10 below). The ICES advice rule optimizes yield while maintaining 
    low levels of risk by incorporating the uncertainty in the estimated biomass
    and fishing mortality into the short-term forecast, using the 35th percentile 
    as opposed to the medians of estimated B/B<sub>MSY</sub> and F/F<sub>MSY</sub> distributions. 
    Implementation of harvest control rules to reduce fishing mortality provides 
    scope for stock recovery but does not guarantee recovery. </p>
